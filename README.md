# Fitness Tracker

  # Description
As a USER, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. <br>
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. <br>
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. <br>
If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
